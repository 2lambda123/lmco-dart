This migration loads the bare minimum data to missions.Color and missions.ClassificationLegend for the application
to operate. Failure to run this migration will (probably) result in devastating application errors.

More colors and classifications can be loaded for you from the included common_classifications fixture:

python manage.py loaddata common_classifications

(Or you can just run `python /install/offline/setup.py` and they'll be added for you)
